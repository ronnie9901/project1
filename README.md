# Todo App 📝

## Overview 🌟

This Flutter Todo app allows users to interact with a list of todos fetched from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos). The app features the ability to toggle between List and Grid view, differentiate completed and pending todos by color, and allows the user to switch between Dark and Light themes. The app saves the user's last selected view and theme preference using SharedPreferences.

### Features ✨:
1. **Fetch Todos from API** 🔄: The app fetches todo items from [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) and displays them in a user-friendly interface.
2. **Toggle Between List & Grid View** 🔲➡️📃: Users can toggle between a List or Grid view to display their todos. The selected view is saved using SharedPreferences, so it persists even after the app is restarted.
3. **Differentiated Todos** ✅❌: Completed and pending todos are visually distinguished by different colors, making it easy for users to quickly identify the status of their tasks.
4. **Dark & Light Theme** 🌙☀️: The app supports both Dark and Light themes, with the user's last modified theme preference saved using SharedPreferences. The app remembers the last theme used, providing a seamless experience for the user.
5. **Attractive UI** 🎨: The app is designed with an attractive user interface that is both functional and visually appealing.
6. **Full-Screen Video Demo** 🎥: The app includes a full-screen video showcasing the features, including code snippets demonstrating the various functionalities.
